## Project 1 ;- [Mortgage Loan Prediction](https://github.com/Opiano1/Mortgage-Approval-Loan-Prediction) 

+ Goal

The goal is to predict whether a mortgage application was accepted (meaning the loan was originated) or denied according to the given dataset, which is adapted from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's (FFIEC).

The insights into the analysis can be found [here](https://fabiyiopeyemi94.medium.com/datathon2020-predicting-weather-disruption-of-public-transport-86373a19e6bc)



## Project 2 :- [Disaster Response Analysis](https://github.com/Opiano1/Data-Scientist-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/master/Disaster%20Response%20Pipeline)

+ Goal

This project was made avaialable as part projects for successful completion of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. The dataset contains labeled data and tweets, messages from real-life disasters using Natural Language Process (NLP) to perform necessary text preparation and using Machine Learning pipelines for the text classifications.
